This is a SAE / qantm student project


Overview:
Several trimesters ago a project built around the idea of generating
a “coffee table” book for Studio 3 student work was launched. The
result was an event driven, well designed and produced “art” book
with an accompanying website.
The project has since been successfully revived. The current
iterations of Collectiva have had a significant change and focusses
on showcasing the personal creations of all Uber Studio students.
The intention is a high production-value printed media featuring
the students, their work and interests. The printed media should be
more than a book. It should reflect the unique abilities and attitudes
of the people showcased within.
The printed media will be accompanied by a new media product
that continues the experience and houses works that are not well
presented on paper. The new media product should be more
than a flat website. The goal should be something that utilises rich
visual and audio media. It should move and engage the audience
in the product as well as the content. The two products should be
considered of equal value and neither should be a mirror of the
other.
As the delivery platforms are fundamentally different their
treatment of media and experiential engagement should contrast
substantially, but be visually linked.
All contributors will be asked to produce works responding to a
given theme and meeting the required specifications.

Audience
The intended audience for this project is two fold. The first audience
are the current studio three students. The second audience would
be an extension of this and includes potential employers, friends,
family and other interested parties. It is anticipated that SAE
marketing may want extra copies for promotion.

Visual ID: 
The current visual identity does not need to be maintained. As this
is a new trimester with the potential for broad expansion, the visual
identity can be rebuilt and expanded.

Legalities: All work shown in this publication (both print and new media)
must be the students own work. Material of any nature that is part
of, contributed to, or has been referenced in featured student
works MUST BE accompanied by appropriate permissions or face
exclusion.

Promotion: 
The previous Collectiva teams started social media accounts for
the purpose of documenting the progress and promotion of the
final product. These will need to be maintained regularly across the
trimester.

Deliverables: 
The deliverables are the conventional media product and the new
media experience.
The exact nature of the convential media and the new media
experience is open to negotiation. However both should contain the
same core information:
• Student info (name, discipline, personal statement, preferred
medium, career outcome)
• Student works
Despite the differences in delivery, the visual identity should be
consistent across both platforms.
The new media item should have analytics, SEO and usability
testing (where appropriate). The results of this process need to be
documented.
